# JavaSoft
- A very simple software 3D renderer written in Java

To compile and run, simply run `run.sh`

# Further plans
I want to keep this as a very simple, educational example. However, I do want to demonstrate a few more of the not-so-intuitive features of a renderer. This is a list of features I plan to add, but is still todo:
- Perspective projection
- Clipping
- Custom rasterization
- Depth map
- Filled triangles
- Lighting
- "shaders"?
- Textures
- More features for transforms in the linalg library
